## "Good Food, Good Life" - Nestle

I'm delighted to write the first article of my guidebook. Nestle is quite special for me, since I've analyzed this company in my major course when attending the University.<br>
Today, we're going to get to know about the Nestle Korea's business and their performance. Please enjoy our journey.

In June 2014, Nestle Korea and Lotte Group invested 50% of each to establish a joint venture and officially launched Lotte-Nestle Korea Co., Ltd. Lotte-Nestle Korea own the instant coffee and powdered beverages business, F&B business called Nestle Professional, and the Pet care business. And the rest of business units, such as capsule coffee business, confectionery and nutrition, are operated by Nestle Korea Ltd. which was owned by Nestle S.A. 100%.

### 2. Business Results
I'll mainly introduce coffee products which are representative for each companies.

#### Market Share

<b>(1) Nestle Korea Ltd.</b><br>
Nespresso's domestic capsule coffee market share reached about 82%.(As of 2019) And Illy, Lavazza, Capitally(Coffee bean & Tea leaf), and Tasimo(Dongsuh) are struggling fiercely for the remaining 18%.<br>
<b>(2) Lotte-Nestle Korea Co., Ltd.</b><br>
Since launching “Taster's Choice” (now Nescafe) in 1989, Lotte-Nestle Korea had maintained above 10% of market share for over 20 years, as the undisputed second place in the industry.<br>
But, after Namyang entered this coffee mix market as "French Cafe" in 2012, Nestle's market share has declined to a single digit. Namyang ranked second with the 12.5% of market share, with a clever promotional phrase "put fat-free milk, not sodium caseinate in the coffee prim", while Nestle's market share fell to third place with only 5.1% of market share.<br>
