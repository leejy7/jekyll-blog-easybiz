### A letter to read before opening Izzy's easy guide

Welcome! You've find the right place! This blog is a kind of guidebook designed with the highlights for easy understanding by looking into a little part of success stories of global companies winning in Korea or Korean companies succeeding overseas market. I was inspired by 「For dummies」 series. It might seem difficult at first, but this guidebook enables you to make your journey toward business success easier and wonderful, I wish.

> Nice to meet you! I am Izzy, the writer of this book.

It said, “Korea is a good test bed when global companies decided to expand their business to Asia market.” It means you can succeed in other Asian markets, if you satisfy Korean consumers, since Korean consumers have shown the accurate and quick response because they are trendy and meticulous about the quality of products.
Fortunately, I've worked in 3 different global consumer goods companies which are well-known in Korea as their brands. Then, I became curious about:
“What's the key of this company's success? What's the secret won the hearts of Korean consumers? On the other hand, what about cases of Korea companies successfully expanding overseas? Maybe I could learn any insights from there, couldn't I?”
This guidebook begins here. <br>

I organized the chapters of this book as follows. I'm going to introduce companies which have shown remarkable growth in each industry group classified as the below table.
(I'll try to cover as many various areas as possible, but I am likely to do the fields I'm interested in more often!)
The contents would mainly consist of company overview, business performance, marketing strategy analysis, and marketing activity examples.

It's up to you what you learn here and what strategies you apply to your business. But aside from it, my writing itself will be really worthwhile if we take a step forward through my writing.
